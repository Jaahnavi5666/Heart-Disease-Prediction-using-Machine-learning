# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-learning

## Implementation
I have uploaded a single.ipynb file containing the complete code with proper comments and subheadings. I used Google Colab for writing and implementing the code.
## Model Comparison

### Logistic Regression:
* Accuracy: 0.98245
Within the same shell, I have implemented the logistic expression from scratch; the sigmoid function and gradient descent are defined.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
* Accuracy: 0.98245
SVM achieves an accuracy of 0.98245. I used the Scikit-Learn SVC and have preferred an radial basis function kernel, did some trials with other kernels and found rbf giving better accuracy

### Decision Tree Classifier:
* Accuracy: 0.97368
Decision Tree Classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.97368. Used the scikit learn again, with the 100 hidden layers and 500 maximum iterations.

## Summary
* Logistic Regression and SVM have the same accuracy and better than NN in my application.
